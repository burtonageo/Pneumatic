  This is my computer science graphics project which will eventually become
a kick-arse 2D game engine. Right now, it is very basic, and has virtually no
functionality. Features currently in development:

  - Modularise code so that the graphics code can be built as its own library
  - Git submodule libraries
  - Turn the code into a library rather than an application
  - Add a keymap so that key presses can be rebound to different actions
  - Add a GUI system so that buttons/menus can be defined in external fines and drawn simply
  - More futzing around and "refactoring"
